          All of your teeth play an important role in speaking, chewing and in maintaining proper
          alignment of other teeth. Tooth loss doesn’t necessarily have to occur as you age, but if
          you do lose teeth they must be replaced to maintain proper function of your mouth.
          Fortunately, there are options for correcting tooth loss.

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          A bridge a device used to replace missing teeth attaches artificial teeth to adjacent
          natural teeth, called abutment teeth. Bridges are either permanently attached (fixed
          bridges), or they can be removable.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Fixed bridges are applied by either placing crowns on the abutment teeth or by bonding the
          artificial teeth directly to the abutment teeth. Removable bridges are attached to the
          teeth with metal clasps or by precision attachments.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          If you’re missing one or more teeth, you may be aware of their importance to your
          appearance and dental health. Your teeth work together for many daily functions from
          eating to speaking. With missing teeth, its difficult to do these things. Missing teeth
          can and should be replaced. Fixed bridges are a great way to restore your dental health
          and appearance.

          What exactly is a bridge or fixed partial denture?
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          A bridge (fixed partial denture) is a device which fills the gap where teeth are absent.
          Fixed bridges are bonded into place and can only be removed by a dental professional.
          Removable bridges, as the name implies, can be taken out and cleaned. Fixed bridges offer
          more stability than their removable counterparts.

        <p className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl">Why do I need a bridge?</p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Oral functionality and appearance are important reasons for wearing a bridge. A bridge
          helps support your lips and cheeks. The loss of a back tooth may cause your mouth to sink
          and your face to look older.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Dental health is the most important reason for a bridge. Teeth were designed to complement
          each other. Unusual stresses are placed on the gums and other oral tissues when teeth are
          missing, causing a number of potentially harmful disorders.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Increased risk of gum disease has proven to be one of the worst side effects of missing
          teeth and can be minimized with a bridge.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Missing teeth can cause speech disorders as they are used to make many of the sounds we
          use to speak clearly.
        </p>
      </div>

        <p className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl">How is a bridge attached?</p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          The attachment procedure usually takes two or three appointments to complete. At the first
          appointment Dr. Sokol will prepare the teeth on either side of the gap by removing a
          portion of the enamel and dentin.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Since the bridge must be fabricated very precisely to ensure correct bite and to match the
          opposing tooth, impressions of the teeth are taken and sent to a lab where the bridge will
          be constructed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Fixed bridges are typically cemented to the natural teeth next to the space left by the
          missing tooth. A pontic (false tooth) replaces the lost tooth. Crowns, which are cemented
          onto the natural teeth, provide support for the bridge.

        <p className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl">What materials are used?</p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Bridges can be constructed from gold alloys, non-precious alloys, porcelain, or a
          combination of these materials. Porcelain is often bonded to either precious or
          non-precious metal.

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          A strict regimen of brushing and flossing will keep the bridge and surrounding teeth
          clean. This is of critical importance as the bridge relies on the neighboring teeth for
          support.

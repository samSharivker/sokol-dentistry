            All of your teeth play an important role in speaking, chewing and in
            maintaining proper alignment of other teeth. Tooth loss doesn’t
            necessarily have to occur as you age, but if you do lose teeth they
            must be replaced to maintain proper function of your mouth.
            Fortunately, there are options for correcting tooth loss.

              A bridge is a device used to replace missing teeth and attaches
              artificial teeth to adjacent natural teeth, called abutment teeth.
              Bridges are either permanently attached (fixed bridges), or they
              can be removable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8">
              Fixed bridges are applied by either placing crowns on the abutment
              teeth or by bonding the artificial teeth directly to the abutment
              teeth. Removable bridges are attached to the teeth with metal
              clasps or by precision attachments.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8">
              If you’re missing one or more teeth, you may be aware of their
              importance to your appearance and dental health. Your teeth work
              together for many daily functions from eating to speaking. With
              missing teeth, it's difficult to do these things. Missing teeth
              can and should be replaced. Fixed bridges are a great way to
              restore your dental health and appearance.

              A bridge (fixed partial denture) is a device which fills the gap
              where teeth are absent. Fixed bridges are bonded into place and
              can only be removed by a dental professional. Removable bridges,
              as the name implies, can be taken out and cleaned. Fixed bridges
              offer more stability than their removable counterparts.

              Oral functionality and appearance are important reasons for
              wearing a bridge. A bridge helps support your lips and cheeks. The
              loss of a back tooth may cause your mouth to sink and your face to
              look older.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8">
              Dental health is the most important reason for a bridge. Teeth
              were designed to complement each other. Unusual stresses are
              placed on the gums and other oral tissues when teeth are missing,
              causing a number of potentially harmful disorders.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8">
              Increased risk of gum disease has proven to be one of the worst
              side effects of missing teeth and can be minimized with a bridge.

            <p className="font-bold text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8">
              Missing teeth can cause speech disorders as they are used to make
              many of the sounds we use to speak clearly.

              The attachment procedure usually takes two or three appointments
              to complete. At the first appointment Dr. Sokol will prepare the
              teeth on either side of the gap by removing a portion of the
              enamel and dentin.

            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8">
              Since the bridge must be fabricated very precisely to ensure
              correct bite and to match the opposing tooth, impressions of the
              teeth are taken and sent to a lab where the bridge will be
              constructed.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8">
              Fixed bridges are typically cemented to the natural teeth next to
              the space left by the missing tooth. A pontic (false tooth)
              replaces the lost tooth. Crowns, which are cemented onto the
              natural teeth, provide support for the bridge.

              Bridges can be constructed from gold alloys, non-precious alloys,
              porcelain, or a combination of these materials. Porcelain is often
              bonded to either precious or non-precious metal.

              A strict regimen of brushing and flossing will keep the bridge and
              surrounding teeth clean. This is of critical importance as the
              bridge relies on the neighboring teeth for support.

          Highly effective in preventing decay on the biting surfaces of your chewing teeth, dental sealants are a simple procedure in which a tooth-colored acrylic “coating” is painted onto the surface of the tooth. This effectively “seals” the deep grooves, acting as a barrier and protecting enamel from plaque and acids.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Sealants protect the depressions and grooves of your teeth from food particles and plaque that brushing and flossing can’t reach.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Easy to apply, sealants take only a few minutes to seal each tooth. Sealants hold up well under the force of normal chewing and can last several years before a reapplication is needed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-7 sm:leading-8 max-w-5xl">
          Children and adults can benefit from sealants in the fight against tooth decay.
